<Code Refactoring>

## Description

- In doing this project i found my self challenged at times but, through my mistakes i leanred the importance of semantics when writing html. Not only so what you build does what you intend it to but i found its easier to keep organized which helped when i used css to style the webpage. In simplyfying the html using semantics and consolidating the css using selectors the web page will be much more easy to maintain and have a stronge rbase to expand upon.
